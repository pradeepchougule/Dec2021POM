Page :
- for every page in Web/mobile app, we need to create separate page java class
- never use assertions in page class.
- page actions needs to provide the page behaviour.
- page locators (BY) should be private and will be accessed via public page actions.


Test :
-- have to use a test client : TestNG/Junit/Pytest/Nunit/Jasmine/Mocha
-- assertions should be written in test class
-- never use driver apis in test class
